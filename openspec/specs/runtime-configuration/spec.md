# runtime-configuration Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change remove-legacy-ingest-adapters. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: SemSource has one runtime configuration

SemSource MUST run as an external service without a runtime mode selector. Configuration, environment
processing, schema, examples, logs, and current guidance MUST NOT expose `mode`, `ModeStandalone`,
`SEMSOURCE_MODE`, or another compatibility selector.

#### Scenario: Canonical configuration is loaded

- **WHEN** an operator loads valid SemSource configuration without a mode field
- **THEN** the service initializes its one external-service runtime
- **AND** no mode default or branch is evaluated

#### Scenario: Removed mode field is supplied

- **WHEN** strict top-level JSON decoding encounters `mode`
- **THEN** loading fails with the ordinary unknown-field classification
- **AND** no legacy translation or special removed-mode handler runs

#### Scenario: Removed environment variable is present

- **WHEN** the environment contains `SEMSOURCE_MODE`
- **THEN** SemSource does not read it or change behavior
